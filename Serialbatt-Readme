-------------- SerialBatt branch Readme -------------------

// TODO

-AP_SerialManager currently supports a public method for retrieving the singleton instance. 
It would be nice to do it that way. Right now is the old way, delivering serial_manager to the argument on init()

-Probably there will be needed some tweaks on the serialmanager regarding baud rate. Remember

// Setup

-Select on serial protocol option 19 on desired serial port (type of serial protocol)
-Default baud rate is not set
-Select monitor param, under batt monitor params, option 10 (type of battery monitor)

Voltage and current from monitor1 fully supported. Second current, generator current, just supported for visualization. No logging and no consumed amps, etc etc. 
Need to modify all battmonitor front end architecture for that regard.
