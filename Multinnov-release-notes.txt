------- MN-Uaview-stereo-v2.0

rebased to master on first week of February 2021. Finally we have it working with ekf src firmware. Also we have
make a huge refactor on the commits.

All the avoid and proximity has been updated to 3D in ardupilot, and in this branch we also re did all the particular
of align yaw and wall mode for complying with this new 3d paradigm in avoidance and proximity.

We also have here some spare commits from Rmackay that hasn't yet done it to master. It is indicated in the commit name,
so in the future it is easy to drop them and just rebase master when they get merged.


------- MN-Uaview-stereo-v1.0

First iteration, rebased 2 days before sending the prototype. This is considered the stable version. It has the
same features as 2.0 but it is from an older master

update late january 2021:

We updated the last features to this branch as a stable solution, so this has actually all the new features from
the 2020 November development. This has proven to be stable.
