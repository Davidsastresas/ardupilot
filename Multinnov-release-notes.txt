------- MN/uaviewStereo/v.2.0

- auto flight mode change and automatic ekf source change enabled. 

    if we click in loiter, it will switch automatically
    between alt hold and loiter based on tracking quality.
    if medium or lower will go to alt hold, if high to loiter.
    
    This will follow the transition times given by the parameters
    aut_time, so brief changes don't actually change mode.
    
    Also, in this commit we change to src0 for loiter, and src1 for
    all the rest of flight modes

- max angle control

- disable crash check


------- MN-Uaview-stereo-v2.0

rebased to master on first week of February 2021. Finally we have it working with ekf src firmware. Also we have
make a huge refactor on the commits.

All the avoid and proximity has been updated to 3D in ardupilot, and in this branch we also re did all the particular
of align yaw and wall mode for complying with this new 3d paradigm in avoidance and proximity.

We also have here some spare commits from Rmackay that hasn't yet done it to master. It is indicated in the commit name,
so in the future it is easy to drop them and just rebase master when they get merged.


------- MN-Uaview-stereo-v1.0

First iteration, rebased 2 days before sending the prototype. This is considered the stable version. It has the
same features as 2.0 but it is from an older master

update late january 2021:

We updated the last features to this branch as a stable solution, so this has actually all the new features from
the 2020 November development. This has proven to be stable.
