MN-Uaview-stereo-v2.0

Rebased to master on 12 december 2020, in order to get the new ekf lane functionality. Besides that,
we also implemented here:

- Start in alt hold mode. Note we first tried using start as loiter, but loiter init was problematic as
  it was requesting position from ekf before actually having ekf origin set.

- Start pwm led power to 1015

- Add timers for pwm for camera take photo action. The pwm for photo is mantained 350ms. This was added
  in a 10z new task in the scheduler.

- Fix bug triggering roof/ground mode. Some little fixes for our particular setup. surface was roof at 
  startup, now is NONE

- Don't use avoidance for z. For alt hold and loiter there was a call to avoidance library for calculating
  z climb rate. That was messing with our setup for roof mode, so we disabled it. We only want lidars in z
  comming from roof mode.

MN-Uaview-stereo-v1.0

First iteration, rebased 2 days before sending the prototype. This is considered the stable version. It has the
same features as 2.0 but it is from an older master
